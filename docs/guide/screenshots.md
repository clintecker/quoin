# Screenshot manifest

Quoin's screenshots are **automated**, not hand-captured. Every push to
`main` runs the `ScreenshotTests` UI-test bundle
(`App/macOS/UITests/ScreenshotTests.swift`) on the CI macOS runner
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, the *Capture screenshots* step). The bundle
launches the real app against the fixture library and writes one PNG per
state to `$QUOIN_SCREENSHOT_DIR`; CI uploads them as the `screenshots`
artifact **and** force-pushes them to the `ci-screenshots` branch (fetchable
anywhere the repo is). This file is the durable record of what each shot is,
how it is produced, and where — if anywhere — its curated copy lives under
`docs/images/`.

## How a shot is produced

Chrome and feature surfaces are preset by **launch arguments**, never by
synthetic keyboard events (flaky on headless runners):

- `-QuoinLibraryPath <dir>` — point the app at the fixture library. CI copies
  `Fixtures/*.md` into `/tmp/quoin-fixtures` first, so every fixture below is
  available by name.
- `-QuoinShotOpen <name.md>` — open a library file at launch.
- `-QuoinShotState <state>` — preset a specific chrome/feature state
  (see the state table). Review/properties/footnote/code states open their
  own default fixture when `-QuoinShotOpen` is omitted, so a single
  `-QuoinShotState review` is enough to drive them.
- `-QuoinForceDarkMode YES` — render in dark appearance.
- `-QuoinCodeTheme <id>` — select a code-block syntax theme (argument-domain
  only, so it does not persist). Valid ids live in `CodePalette.registry`
  (`Sources/QuoinRender/Theme.swift`): `graphite`, `one-dark`, `dracula`,
  `github-dark`, `solarized-dark`, `nord`, `tokyo-night`, `catppuccin-mocha`,
  `one-light`, `github-light`, `solarized-light`, `catppuccin-latte`, or
  `match` (follows the app appearance).

`-QuoinShotState` is dispatched in two places by ownership:

- **Window chrome** (`App/macOS/Sources/MainWindow.swift`, `applyShotState`):
  `quickopen`, `libsearch`, plus the default-fixture routing
  (`defaultShotFixture`).
- **Editor chrome** (`App/macOS/Sources/ReaderScreen.swift`, the
  `QuoinShotState` switch in `windowChrome`): `find`, `export`,
  `mermaidResilience`, `codeEdit`, and the new `review`, `properties`,
  `reviewmode`, `codethemes`, `footnotes`.

## `-QuoinShotState` values

| State | Fixture (default) | Presets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `find` | `engines.md`* | Find bar open, query `math` |
| `export` | `engines.md`* | Export sheet presented |
| `quickopen` | — | Quick-open panel, query `show`, results run |
| `libsearch` | — | Library-search panel, query `engine`, results run |
| `mermaidResilience` | (opened doc)* | Self-drives break/fix of a mermaid header (diagnostic) |
| `codeEdit` | `showcase.md`* | Activates first code block + types (diagnostic) |
| `review` | `demo-product-spec.md` | Review inspector on a real spec under review (suggestion + comment cards) |
| `properties` | `demo-daily-note.md` | Properties inspector on a note with rich front matter (typed fields) |
| `reviewmode` | `demo-product-spec.md` | `SUGGESTING` status chip active + Review inspector |
| `codethemes` | `demo-research-note.md` | Scrolls first code block into view (pair with `-QuoinCodeTheme`) |
| `footnotes` | `demo-research-note.md` | Scrolls first footnote reference into view |

\* States marked with an asterisk are driven with an explicit
`-QuoinShotOpen` in the UI test; the others fall back to
`MainWindow.defaultShotFixture`.

## Shot catalogue

Every PNG the bundle writes. **Committed path** is the curated copy under
`docs/images/` that README/PRODUCT reference (blank = artifact/CI-branch
only, not committed).

Hand-curated images not sourced from a single shot (composed/exported
separately): `docs/images/hero.png`,
`docs/images/architecture-overview.png` (+`-dark`),
`docs/images/data-flow.png` (+`-dark`).

## Updating a committed image

1. Trigger CI (push) or run the bundle locally:
   ```sh
   cd App/macOS && xcodegen
   mkdir -p /tmp/quoin-fixtures && cp ../../Fixtures/*.md /tmp/quoin-fixtures/
   TEST_RUNNER_QUOIN_SCREENSHOT_DIR=/tmp/quoin-shots \
   TEST_RUNNER_QUOIN_FIXTURES=/tmp/quoin-fixtures \
   xcodebuild -project Quoin.xcodeproj -scheme Quoin -configuration Debug \
     CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="" test
   ```
   (or `git fetch origin ci-screenshots` after a push to `main`).
2. Copy the shot(s) you want to publish into `docs/images/` under the
   **committed path** named above, and commit them.

Never commit a placeholder PNG: a broken image link is worse than a missing
one. Only add an image to `docs/` once the real pixels exist.
